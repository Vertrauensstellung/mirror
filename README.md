# Mirror

## Overview

**Mirror** is a repository of public cloud environments including information about IPs and common names (CN) from certificates.\
It uses the following IP-Ranges: [IP-Ranges](https://github.com/lord-alfred/ipranges)\
These are scanned in [GO](https://go.dev/doc/install) with [TLSX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/tlsx) and saved as .txt file.

## WHY
The reason why I created this list is to gather intel about a domain, if public cloud environments are used. This information can later be used for more OSINT.
